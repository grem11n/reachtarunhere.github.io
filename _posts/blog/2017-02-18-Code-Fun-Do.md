Participating in Microsoft's Code Fun Do for the third time with Zibbu. The last time was really fruitful, lets see how it goes this time. Given the batch snaps and screening of first and second years I see fewer people around this time. We have an idea finialized. Will reveal soon.

Got the neural net model working. Now lets learn how to do a queue to handle images as byte streams.

We got the basic pre-trained model working for videos. Example above. Unfortunately we failed to get everything working with Youtube (youtube-dl) in the given time.

It was fun nevertheless.
